# LanderPOC

This is a proof of concept for the Lander with a very basic landing problem 
and a code editor to program a solution.

Setup: 
- There is a VIsual Studio solution file that can be opened and run, however 
that is probably overkill as all of the code is client-side and all is needed is 
a basic web-server. 
- Alternately you can use nodeJs to run the code:  
`npm install`  
`npm start`
